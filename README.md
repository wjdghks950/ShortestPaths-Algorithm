# Finding All-source shortest paths
Using all the following shortest paths algorithms to find all-source shortest paths:

## 1) Bellman-Ford algorithm
## 2) Dijkstra's algorithm
## 3) Floyd algorithm

This program intends to compare the three algorithms in terms of their performance by calculating
the time of their execution.

# Prerequites
gcc should be installed for compilation. Otherwise, you can use other IDEs such as Visual Studio.


# Build
$ gcc -o a.out ShortestPaths.c 


#Debug
Use gdb to debug like the following:
  $ gdb ./a.out
  $ run
